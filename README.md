Learning about the DOM and how to manipulate it!

This is a different approach to the repo than was done in the past.

The repo as it stands (I believe) is essentially where the project is when we start working at it at the start of the session.

img/updated_files.zip is a compressed folder containing the version of the project folder as it came to be at the end of the group session.

Hopefully that makes sense! This way you can start with the same slate we start with and build it along with us.

Party on!
